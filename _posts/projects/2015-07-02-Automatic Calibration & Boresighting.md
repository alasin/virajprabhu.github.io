Worked at Tonbo Imaging, Bangalore as a software intern from January-June '15 on the following projects.

Automatic Calibration: Designed and implemented an algorithm in MATLAB for automated computation of intrinsic camera parameters such as field of view, focal length and optical centre with high accuracy using an <a href="http://april.eecs.umich.edu/wiki/index.php/AprilTags">AprilTags</a> target and collimator setup. Promising accuracy was observed across a range of zoom values on both color and infrared cameras.  

Boresighting: Implemented a boresighting application in embedded C on a DM365 processor, including the worklow of calibrating the muzzle reticule as well as the process of aligning the muzzle with the weapon's sighting system.
