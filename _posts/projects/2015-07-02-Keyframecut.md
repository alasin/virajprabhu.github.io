Interned at Adobe Systems, Bangalore from May-July '14, working extensively in Computer Vision and allied fields as part of a two member team.   

Work responsibilities:  
1) Designed and implemented a novel Grabcut-based segmentation algorithm – ‘Keyframe Cut’ for
real-time background removal and substitution in videos that fused color, motion, shape prior and
adaptive background cues. It was developed in C++ as a feature for the e-learning content authoring
tool, Adobe Presenter, and demonstrated promising results under reasonable constraints for the
background.  
2) Developed a prototype of a first of its kind preview feedback system to automatically identify poor
quality backgrounds.  
3) Presented demos to the Senior Product Director and researchers at Adobe Advanced Technology
Labs, Seattle, and work is currently underway to integrate the feature in the next release of Adobe
Presenter.
