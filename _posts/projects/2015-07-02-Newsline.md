Newsline is a news aggregator that crawls and retrieves articles
within a user-defined time period from news sources, and performs event-centric Hierarchical Agglomerative Clustering to identify articles pertaining to the same story.  

The optimal partitioning of the HAC tree is determined by maximizing the silhouette score over all possible partitions, and results in clusters of articles covering the same event. Finally, the user enters a search query and is chronologically presented with the stories contained in the most relevant cluster.
