Dark Places:


Gone Girl:

Her novels are certainly not for the weak of heart or for those who prefer their endings sugar coated with a cherry on top. Add to that a certain formula for cracking her whodunit's that made her first two novels a bit of a letdown for me, and you have an author that simply isn't going to be everyone's cup of tea.

But those grouses aside, what really sucked me in were the everyday insights her novels are generously sprinkled with; blunt, pithy observations that ring true and stay with you the last page is turned. Be it her cynical take on the inner dynamics of a marriage in Gone Girl, the utter awkwardness and hopelessness of growing up poor in Dark Places, or the constant inner turmoil of a complex person in Sharp Objects, each was a mirror that reflected some ugly human traits in its conflicted nakedness - and made no excuses for it either. Another strength is her ability to paint a picture of a world with atmospheric prose, quickly swapping between points of view to reveal character quirks and motivations.
